# Idea 1 - Weather Playlist

Take the spotfy API that prompts users to log in, have users input their zipcode and check the forecast for that day and make a playlsit based off of the mood.

Potential add-on: BeReal like feature

We start off by having the data sign into their Spotify and inputting their zipcode. We use a weather API to search for the temperature, rain, so on. and based off of that and our own computations we build a playlist on their profile. For the database, we have each user create a profile and then log their playlists and once a day we can pull a BeReal and have the user submit the song they're listening to.

# Idea 2 - Weather fit

Take weather data from a database and make an outfit out of it. Idea for third party authentication? Sign into bank account to check how much money they have to spend on clothes lol
