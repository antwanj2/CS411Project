# Idea 1 - Weather Playlist

Take the spotfy API that prompts users to log in, have users input their zipcode and check the forecast for that day and make a playlsit based off of the mood.

# Idea 2 - Weather fit

Take weather data from a database and make an outfit out of it. Idea for third party authentication? Sign into bank account to check how much money they have to spend on clothes lol
