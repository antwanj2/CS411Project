## Primary User Story #1 - New User sign up process

I am a new user opening the app for the first time. The opening screen contains an option to log into an exisiting account or to create a new account for a new user - which I am. When creating an account I am asked for a unique username and password. Once logged into the app, I am asked to log into my Spotify account and link it in order to get full function of the app and get playlists made for me based on the weather. I am also asked for my zip code for accurate weather and playlist predictions. I then have different options to personalize my profile. Finally, I am led to a "Generate Playlist" button.
