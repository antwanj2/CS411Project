## Primary User Story #1 - New User sign up process

I am a new user opening the app for the first time. The opening screen contains an option to log into the app through my Spotify account. Once logged in through Spotify, I can get full function of the app and get playlists made for me based on the weather. I am also asked for my zip code for accurate weather and playlist predictions.  Finally, the playlist automatically starts playing.
