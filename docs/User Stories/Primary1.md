## Primary User Story #1 - New User sign up process

I am a new user opening the app for the first time. The opening screen contains an option to log into an exisiting account or to create a new account for a new user - which I am. When creating an account I am asked for a unique username and password. Once logged into the app, I am asked to link my Spotify account in order to get full function of the app and get playlists made for me based on the weather, as well as my zip code so the weather predictions are accurate.  
so that I can save time deciding on my music before my commute
