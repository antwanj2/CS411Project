## Primary User Story #3 - Existing User general use workflow
As an existing/logged in user opening app on a new day I want to get my playlist quick so I can leave the house quick

The idea is for this singular user, their information is already inputted, they are logged into their spotify and they have input their zipcode and they are signed in within the app already. This process needs to be quick and easy for them because they are probably in a rush to get to work and just got into the car about to drive.
The user is supposed to open up the application, and right in front of their face will be a big button that says "generate playlist" and they will hit the button and the
playlist will be crafted for them. This will use the Spotify create playlist API that will create a new playlist on this person's account named "current-date playlist"
And then their use of the app is over, they can use the playlist while they commute and choose to delete it after or not.
