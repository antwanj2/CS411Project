## User Story ideas

**Primary user stories:**
 1. I am a new user logging into google and entering zip code and logging into spotify so that I can save time deciding on my music before my commute
 2. As an existing user I want to change my zip code so that I can get data from a new place when I travel
 3. As an existing/logged in user opening app on a new day I want to get my playlist quick so I can leave the house quick
 
 **Secondary user stories:**
 1. As an existing user I want to delete my account so that my data isn't held anymore
 2. As an existing user I want to unlink my spotify account so that it's no longer connected
