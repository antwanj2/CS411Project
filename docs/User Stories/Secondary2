as an existing user i want to unlink my spotify account so that it's no longer connected

This idea is for the user who doesn’t want to link the Spotify account. The user might want to listen to a particular song that is not in the Spotify app.
For example, the user was unhappy with the spotify recommendation algorithm on the account that user was using currently, so the user created a new account to build up the new recommendation algorithm and link back to the app with the new account. 
This process needs to be simple, so if we hit the “User Information” tab and inside the tab, there would be a “Unlink my Spotify” button. 
After that, we will ask the reason for unlinking Spotify. Then it is done.
