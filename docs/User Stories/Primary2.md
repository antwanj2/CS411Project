## Primary User Story #2 - Existing User zipcode update

As an existing user I want to change my zip code so that I can get data from a new place when I travel.

The idea behind this is that the web application should be versatile. The user will be logged in and on the home page to start.
The city/zip code's weather and mood will be displayed on the screen. Near this will be an button that says 'change location', 
here the user will enter the 5 digit zip code of the place they are traveling to. The user will then be asked if
they would like to confirm or deny these changes. If the user clicks deny then no changes will be made to the home page. If the user clicks accept:
The homepage will reflect these changes by changing the city/zip code's weather, if the weather does change then the mood and music playlist 
will also be updated on the homepage. These changes will occur automatically after a user clicks accept.
