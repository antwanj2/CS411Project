## Primary User Story #2 - Existing User zipcode update

As an existing user I want to change my zip code so that I can get data from a new place when I travel.

The idea behind this is that the web application should be versatile. The user will be logged in and on the home page, 
the city/zipcode's weather will be displayed as well as the mood of the weather. Near this will be an button for change location, 
here the user will enter the 5 digit zipcode of the place their traveling to. The user will then be aske after this they will be asked if 
they would like to confirm or deny these changes. If the user clicks deny no changes will be made to the home page. If the user clicks accept:
The homepage will reflect these changes by changing the city/zipcode/s weather, if the weather does change then the mood and music playlist 
will also be updated on the homepage. These changes will occur automatically after a user clicks acceot.
