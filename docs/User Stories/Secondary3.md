## Secondary User Story #3 - Connect with other users 

As an existing user I want to connect with my friends and view their playlists. 

After completing user registration ([Primary User Story 1](./Primary1.md)), the user may want to connect with other users on the app and view their playlists. One of the personalization steps will require the user to select a privacy setting: Public or Private.

* For a Public account, anyone will be able to follow the user and view their playlists. 

* For a Private account, users will need to request to follow the user in order to view their playlists. 

To find accounts to follow, users may: 
1. Search a Username 
2. Follow accounts they follow on their Spotify account (given those users are registered for our app)
3. Find recommended Public accounts based on common artists/genres
