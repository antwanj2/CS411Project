## Secondary User Story #1 - Delete Existing Account

As an existing user I want to delete my account so that my data isn't held anymore.

After completing user registration [Primary User Story 1](./Primary1.md), the user may want to delete their accound if they are unsattisfied with the application or simply are no longer interested in using it. In the settings page, there will be a "Delete My Account" button that the user can easily locate and click on. They will then be prompted to check a confirmation box that will ask them if they want to permanently delete their account to avoid accidental deletion. If desired, the user may also specify the reason for deleting their account, this way, our team can use this feedback to improve our application. Once confirmed, the user's information will be permanently removed from our database. They will need to register their accont again by following the sign-up steps detailed in [Primary User Story 1](./Primary1.md) if they want to use the application again. 

Note: The "Delete My Account" button should be highlighted in - red - , which is typically more intuitive.
