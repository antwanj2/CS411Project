First we debated which language we would all prefer to use and we were deciding between Javascript and Python because one of our members has experience
with Javascript but ultimately we decided on using Python which let us research the best framework to use with Python which led us to finding Django.
We decided on python because it is good for us to learn how to use a new language for a project and it is something we all have the basics of (and it is
a big bonus that it's already downloaded on our computer!)
