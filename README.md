Play The Weather is an app that can generate a playlist based on the weather at your location.  <br /> 
Simply log in with your Spotify account, let us know where you are (zipcode), and we will take care of the rest!

## Project description

In this project, we aim to create a Spotify playlist based on the weather at the user's location (mood: rainy=sad, etc) and the user's favorite artists/genres. Potential add-on: BeReal like feature, where the user gets a notification at a random time during the day and is prompted to share the last song they listened to. This application could help users save time when it comes to finding a playlist that matches your mood - we will create one just for you! This app also has potential to help ease feelings of seasonal depression.
